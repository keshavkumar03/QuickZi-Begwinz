# QuickZi - Ride-Hailing App

QuickZi is a ride-hailing mobile application inspired by popular services like Ola, Uber, and Rapido. The app allows users to request rides, confirm pickup and drop-off locations using an interactive map, and track their journey in real-time.

## Features
- **User Authentication**: Sign up and log in using email and password.
- **Real-Time Location**: View your current location on a map and choose pickup/drop-off points by tapping on the map or manually entering the location.
- **Interactive Map**: Integration with Google Maps or Mapbox to display the user's location and interact with the map.
- **Ride Confirmation**: After confirming pickup and drop-off locations, the app connects with nearby drivers and displays their information.
- **Driver Matching**: The app finds and assigns nearby drivers.
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time updates on ride progress with a progress bar.
- **Driver Info Display**: Once a driver is confirmed, show their name, vehicle number, photo, and phone number.
- **Real-Time Journey Updates**: Track the journey with live updates during the ride.

## Tech Stack

### Frontend (React Native)
- **React Native**: For building the mobile application (Android & iOS).
- **React Navigation**: For managing screen navigation between SignUp, Login, and Ride screens.
- **Axios**: For making HTTP requests to the backend.
- **React Native Maps**: For map functionality (displaying current location, pickup/drop locations, and driver location).
- **Google Maps API / Mapbox**: Used for maps and geolocation services.

### Backend (Node.js with Express.js)
- **Node.js**: Backend server to handle authentication, ride requests, and real-time updates.
- **Express.js**: Framework for building API endpoints.
- **MongoDB**: Database for storing user information and ride data.
- **JWT Authentication**: For user authentication and session management.
- **WebSocket (or Firebase)**: For real-time updates and communication between users and drivers.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **Node.js** installed on your machine.
- **MongoDB** for the database.
- **React Native CLI** or **Expo** to run the app on a mobile device or emulator.
- **Google Maps API Key** or **Mapbox Access Token** for map integration.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/quickzi.git
   cd quickzi
   ```

2. Install the dependencies for the **backend**:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm install
   ```

3. Install the dependencies for the **frontend**:
   ```bash
   cd ../frontend
   npm install
   ```

4. Set up environment variables:
   - In the `backend` directory, create a `.env` file with the following:
     ```bash
     MONGODB_URI=<your-mongodb-uri>
     JWT_SECRET=<your-jwt-secret>
     ```

   - In the `frontend`, configure your **Google Maps API** or **Mapbox Token** in the appropriate place (e.g., in your `MapScreen.js` file).

5. Start the **backend** server:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm start
   ```

6. Run the **React Native** app:
   - If you are using Expo:
     ```bash
     cd ../frontend
     expo start
     ```
   - If using React Native CLI, run:
     ```bash
     react-native run-android   # for Android
     react-native run-ios       # for iOS
     ```

### Usage

- **Sign Up/Login**: Users can sign up and log in to access the app.
- **Request a Ride**: After login, users can select their pickup and drop-off locations by tapping on the map or entering the address manually.
- **Track Your Ride**: Once a driver accepts the ride, users can view the driver’s details and track their progress on the map.

## Future Features
- **Driver App**: A separate app or module for drivers to accept ride requests and share real-time location.
- **Payment Integration**: Implement payment gateways for in-app payments (e.g., PayPal, Stripe, Google Pay).
- **Ride History**: Show users their past ride history.
- **Notifications**: Real-time notifications for ride updates, promotions, etc.
